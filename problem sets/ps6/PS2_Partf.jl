# Purpose
Recreation of PS2_Partf.m matlab code originally written 
by Peter Maxted and updated by Ethan M. L. McClure in 2017

Changes by Aaron
- simplified code by removing all parts that were not changing by only changing STEP
- moved all remaining functions into this script (from the extra functions in the main folder)

# Description (from PS2_Partf.m)
Code for Simple Buffer Stock Model

Model Outline:
Let Y denote the income earned by the agent.
        -->  Deterministic y = 1 during work;

Let A_t represent liquid assets in period t (after earning income Y)
        -->A_t has a minimum (credit limit) set by variable borrowingLimit
        -->A_t earns a real rate of return R

Let I_t denote investment into the liquid asset X during period t

Dynamic Budget Constraint: A_t+1 = R(A_t - C_t) + Y
Borrowing Constraint:  A_t+1 - Y = R(A_t - C_t) >= credit limit

------------------------------------------------------------------
State Variables: A_t, t

Choice Variable: I_t
        -->Consumption is calculated as a residual
------------------------------------------------------------------


Agent Decision Framework:
Agent's have log utility and discount at rate delta

Let V(A_t+1) denote the continuation payoff of self t (given state variables A_t+1, t+1)
    --> Self t's Bellman equation is: max[ u(C_t) + delta * E(V(A_t+1)) ]

UPDATE 1/8/17: Now allowing for sophisticated and naive quasi-hyperbolic discounting.
    --> If specified, self t's Bellman equation is: max[ u(C_t) + beta-hat* delta * E(V(A_t+1)) ]


Simulation:
The code first generates policy and value functions at every combination of state variables.
    --> See function backwardInduction and code backwardInduction_general.m 
    --> E.g., variables C__, V__

Using these policy and value functions, profiles for 5000 simulated agents are generated 
    --> See function simulateDecisions and code simulateDecisions.m
    --> E.g., variables realC__, realY__

                DIFFERENCES BETWEEN JULIA AND MATLAB
============================================================================
Structs:
- Matlab uses structs - those exist in Julia but you can't add struct fields on the fly like in matlab
- Instead we'll use dictionaries, which will operate nearly the same is structs in the matlab code

Switch - case:
- this is the same as if, elseif, else.

#Savings Account X Parameters

#As a default, set the borrowing limit so that it doesn't bind
#	i.e., set the borrowing limit low enough that agents will never choose to hit it
#	How can we do this? Set borrowingLimit = -1 * (incomeWorkMin / (R-1)) - incomeWorkMin.
#	Why? If the agent earns incomeWorkMin in period t+1, then his income is only enough to 
#		pay interest on debt, leaving the principal unchanged. 
#		If the agent lives for a finite number of years, there is a non-zero probability she
#		will earn incomeWorkMin in ALL remaining periods, and therefore must consume a non-positive
#		amount in order to repay debts. However, the Inada condition prevents the agent from
#		ever choosing this path. Hence, the borrowing limit does not bind.
