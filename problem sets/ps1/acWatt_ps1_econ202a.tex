\problem{Constant-Elasticity-of-Substitution Production Functions}{
    Consider the production function
    \begin{equation}
    Y = F(K,L) = A[aK^\phi + (1-a) L^\phi]^{1/\phi}
    \label{eq:F2}
    \end{equation}
    where $0<a<1$ and $\phi<1$.
    \vspace{1em}

    Recall that the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is the curvature of the isoquants of the production function. The slope of an isoquant is
    \begin{equation*}
        \slope = \frac{\partial F(\cdot)/\partial K}{\partial F(\cdot)/\partial L}
    \end{equation*}

    The elasticity is then
    \begin{equation*}
    \left[
        \frac{\partial (\slope)}{\partial (L/K)}
        \frac{L/K}{\slope}
    \right]^{-1}
    \end{equation*}

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item Show that the elasticity of subtitution of the production function \eqref{eq:F2} is constant and equal to $1/(1-\phi)$.

    \dfdl &= A\frac{1}{\phi}[...]^{1/\phi-1}(1-a)L^{\phi-1}
\intertext{So, with some cancellation, the slope is then}
    \slope &= \dfrac{\frac{\partial F}{\partial K}}{\frac{\partial F}{\partial L}} \\
        &= \frac{a}{1-a}\left(\frac{K}{L}\right)^{\phi-1} \\
        &= \frac{a}{1-a}\left(\frac{L}{K}\right)^{1-\phi}

    &= \frac{a}{1-a}(1-\phi)\left(\frac{L}{K}\right)^{-\phi} \\

\intertext{And finally, the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is}
\left[
    \frac{\partial (\slope)}{\partial (L/K)}
    \frac{L/K}{\slope}

\section*{Problem 3}
\problem{The Harrod-Domar Model}{
    Prior to the development of the Solow model, work on development and growth often used a Leontief production function
    \begin{equation}
        Y = F(K,L) = min(AK, BL),
        \label{eq:F3}
    \end{equation}
    where $A=0$ and $B=0$. As we discussed above, this corresponds to a CES production function with $\phi\to -\infty$. Well-known papers to use this type of production function are Harrod (1939) and Domar (1946). Growth models that use this production function have since usually been referred to as Harrod-Domar models. Harrod and Domar predicted that capitalist economies would suffer from persistent problems of unemployment of either labor or machines. We now explore how this conclusion follows from the production function \eqref{eq:F3}.
    \vspace{1em}

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Rewrite the production function \eqref{eq:F3} in terms of per capita output $y$ and capital per capita $k$. Plot the resulting production function as a function of $k$. Also plot the marginal product of capital as a function of $k$.
