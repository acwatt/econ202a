\problem{Growth, saving, and $r-g$: Romer 2.6}{
    Piketty (2014) argues that a fall in the growth rate
of the economy is likely to lead to an increase in the difference between the real
interest rate and the growth rate. This problem asks you to investigate this issue
in the context of the Ramsey Cass Koopmans model. Specifically, consider a
Ramsey Cass Koopmans economy that is on its balanced growth path, and suppose
there is a permanent fall in $g$.

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item How, if at all, does this affect the $\kdot = 0$ curve?
    \end{enumerate} 
}


\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{1.a}


In the plot above, we can see a decrease in $g$
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\implies$] a decrease in the slope of $(n+g)k$
    \item[$\implies$] increase in the $k$ where $f(k)-(n+g)k=0$
    \item[$\implies$] increase in the $k$ where the $\kdot=0$ curve meets the $k$ axis
\end{itemize}

A decrease in the slope of $(n+g)k$ also implies that the distance between $(n+g)k$ and $f(k)$ will be larger $\forall k$ between 0 and where $f(k)-(n+g)k=0$.

\noindent
So, overall, a decrease in $g$ implies a vertical and horizontal stretch outward for the $\kdot = 0$ curve.

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{1.b}

Because $f'>0$ and $f''<0$ by assumption, the plot of $f'$ is shaped as in the above plot. Then when $g$ has decreased from $g_1$ to $g_2$, the intersection with $f'$ occurs at a higher $k^*$. Since $\ccdot=0$ occurs when $f'=\rho+\theta g$ and $\rho, \theta$ are constants, then the $\ccdot=0$ curve shifts to the right to a higher $k^*$.

Since $k_1^* < k_2^*$ from the plot in part (b), we know that the saddle path to new balanced growth path equilibrium point will increase consumption and capital (the path will lead up and to the right). However, without estimated values of the fundemental parameters, we cannot tell if the saddle path will be above or below the old balanced growth path point.

In the plot below, I give two illustrations of a new saddle path that creates an instantaneous increase in $c$ (left) and and instantaneous decrease in $c$ (right). It's also possible that the saddle path to the new balanced growth path perfectly intersects the starting balanced growth path, in which case $c$ would stay the same \textit{at the time of the change}. However, since this outcome depends on the values of the parameters along the real number line, this no-change outcome would happen with probability zero unless the permanent fall in $g$ was somehow engineered to intersect the saddle path with our starting balanced growth path.

Since there is no depreciation, the real interest rate $r$ is equal to the marginal product of capital $f'(k)$ (since the price of output is assumed to be 1).

\begin{align*}
    \intertext{So}
    r-g &= f'(k) - g

    f'(k_1^*) - g_1

    f'(k_1^*) - g_2

\begin{align*}
    \intertext{Continuing my notation from parts (b)-(d), in the long run,}
    \lim_{t\to\infty}f'(k) &= f'(k_2^*)
    \intertext{So the change in $r-g$ in the long run will be}
    (r|_{g_2}-g_2) - (r|_{g_1}-g_1) &= (f'(k_2^*)-g_2) - (f'(k_1^*)-g_1) \\
        &= (\rho +\theta g_2 -g_2) - (\rho +\theta g_1-g_1) \\
        &= (\rho +(\theta-1) g_2) - (\rho +(\theta-1)g_1) \\
        &= (\theta-1) (g_2-g_1) \\

            <0 &\text{ if } \theta > 1
        \end{cases}
\end{align*}

Since there is no upper constraint on $\theta$ from the utility function ($\theta\in (0,1)$ and $\theta > 1$ both produce an upward sloping, convex function), then there is no way to tell, in general, if $r-g$ rises or falls without an estimate of $\theta$.

From our graphical example in parts (a) and (b), we can see that the balanced growth path moves from point D to F when the growth rate decreases. We can think of this as shifts down the old $\ccdot=0$ curve from point D to point E, then a shift along the new $\kdot=0$ curve to the new $\ccdot=0$ curve from point E to point F. From the picture, we can see that there's an unambiguous decrease in $c$ from point D to point E, but the total effect going from point D to F depends on where we started on the $\kdot=0$ curve and the relative size of the changes in the $\ccdot=0$ and $\kdot=0$ curves.

In the picture above, we see a decrease in steady-state $c$ (increase in the savings rate. But we could also imagine starting further to the right on the first $\kdot=0$ curve and ending at a point F that is higher than point D.

\problem{Capital taxation in the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model: Romer 2.10}{
    Consider a Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans economy that is on its balanced growth path. Suppose
that at some time, which we will call time 0, the government switches to a policy
of taxing investment income at rate $\tau$. Thus the real interest rate that households
face is now given by \[r(t) = (1-\tau) f'(k(t)).\] Assume that the government returns
the revenue it collects from this tax through lump-sum transfers. Finally, assume
that this change in tax policy is unanticipated.

\vspace{3em}

We can see in the top panel to the left that the level of capital $k^*$ that satisfies the consumption Euler equation decreases from $\kone$ to $\ktwo$ when the new tax is introduced. This implies the change in the steady state level of consumption ($c$ where $\ccdot=0$) as we see in the middle panel. Before the tax is introduced, we assume that the economy was at point A in the bottom panel. Immediately after the unanticipated tax is introduced, the amount of capital has not had time to change, so it is still at $\kone$. The new steady state point with the tax is point C, where the new $\ccdot=0$ locus intersects the $\kdot=0$ locus. But in order to be on the saddle path to their new steady state C, consumers must increase their consumption from point A up to point B immediately after the tax is introduced (an instantaneous jump in this model).

Thus, consumers first jump to point B, then follow their saddle path to point C in order to follow their Euler equation. Where the concavity of the saddle path is determined by the utility parameter $\theta$.

    \item Do citizens in low-$\tau$, high-$k^*$, high-saving countries have any incentive to invest in low-saving countries? Why or why not?
    \end{enumerate} 
}

The $\ccdot=0$ condition implies that $r(t) = \rho + \theta g$, hence the steady-state real interest rate is constant \textit{and independent of the tax rate} $\t$ (Barro et al. 1995). Since all countries share the fundamental parameters $\rho, \theta$, and $g$, the steady-state real interest rate is the same for all countries. Because the real interest is the same, there is no incentive for low-$\tau$, high-$k^*$ countries to invest in low-$k^*$ (low savings) countries. This is a result of the simplicity of the model and Barro goes on to discuss how including capital frictions play a role in predicting the rates of convergence of poor and rich countries -- namely that including those frictions only changes the speed of convergence a small amount.

    \end{enumerate} 
}

In all cases, subsidizing investment will move the $\ccdot=0$ curve to a higher $k^*$. This is because $(1-\t)>1$ and $\dfrac{\rho+\theta g}{1-\t}<\rho+\theta g$, therefore the $\dfrac{\rho+\theta g}{1-\t}$ will intersect $f'(k)$ at a higher $k$ (and this intersection is the solution to the $\ccdot=0$ condition). But whether this higher $k^*$ induces higher welfare depends on where our starting balanced growth path $k-c$ point is (where $\ccdot=0$ and $\kdot=0$). 

\begin{itemize}
    \item If the shift to a higher $k^*$ along the $\kdot=0$ curve results in a higher $c^*$, then steady-state consumption has increased and welfare has improved.
    \item If the shift to a higher $k^*$ along the $\kdot=0$ curve results in a lower $c^*$, then steady-state consumption has decreased and welfare has decreased.
\end{itemize}

If we are not already at the golden rule level of capital, then there exists some tax or subsidy that would induce a welfare increase and shift to the golden rule level of captial.

    \item How, if at all, do the answers to parts (a) and (b) change if the government does not rebate the revenue from the tax but instead uses it to make government purchases?
    \end{enumerate} 
}

The government spending does not change the $\ccdot$ equation from parts (a) and (b), thus the $k^*$ remains the same. However, the new $\kdot=0$ equation becomes $c=f(k)-(n+g)k-G$, where $G$ is the government spending of the tax revenue. This just means that the $\kdot=0$ curve is translated downward by $G$ units of consumption. The economy jumps to the new balanced growth path at the same $k^*$ and lower $c^*$. 

From the figure in part (b), the point C in the bottom panel would simply be shifted downward. So depending on how large $G$ is (or $\t$), point B would either be below or above point A. So if $G$ was large enough, point B could be below point A, and consumption might jump down instead of up in order to get on the new saddle path to the balanced growth path (the new point C).
