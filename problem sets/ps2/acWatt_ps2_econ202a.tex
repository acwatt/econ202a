\problem{Growth, saving, and $r-g$: Romer 2.6}{
    Piketty (2014) argues that a fall in the growth rate
of the economy is likely to lead to an increase in the difference between the real
interest rate and the growth rate. This problem asks you to investigate this issue
in the context of the Ramsey Cass Koopmans model. Specifically, consider a
Ramsey Cass Koopmans economy that is on its balanced growth path, and suppose
there is a permanent fall in $g$.

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item How, if at all, does this affect the $\kdot = 0$ curve?
    \end{enumerate} 
}


\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{1.a}


In the plot above, we can see a decrease in $g$
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\implies$] a decrease in the slope of $(n+g)k$
    \item[$\implies$] increase in the $k$ where $f(k)-(n+g)k=0$
    \item[$\implies$] increase in the $k$ where the $\kdot=0$ curve meets the $k$ axis
\end{itemize}

A decrease in the slope of $(n+g)k$ also implies that the distance between $(n+g)k$ and $f(k)$ will be larger $\forall k$ between 0 and where $f(k)-(n+g)k=0$.

\noindent
So, overall, a decrease in $g$ implies a vertical and horizontal stretch outward for the $\kdot = 0$ curve.

\problem{Capital taxation in the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model: Romer 2.10}{
    Consider a Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans economy that is on its balanced growth path. Suppose
that at some time, which we will call time 0, the government switches to a policy
of taxing investment income at rate $\tau$. Thus the real interest rate that households
face is now given by \[r(t) = (1-\tau) f'(k(t)).\] Assume that the government returns
the revenue it collects from this tax through lump-sum transfers. Finally, assume
that this change in tax policy is unanticipated.

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
