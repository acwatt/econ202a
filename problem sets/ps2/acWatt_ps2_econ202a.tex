\problem{Growth, saving, and $r-g$: Romer 2.6}{
    Piketty (2014) argues that a fall in the growth rate
of the economy is likely to lead to an increase in the difference between the real
interest rate and the growth rate. This problem asks you to investigate this issue
in the context of the Ramsey Cass Koopmans model. Specifically, consider a
Ramsey Cass Koopmans economy that is on its balanced growth path, and suppose
there is a permanent fall in $g$.

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item How, if at all, does this affect the $\kdot = 0$ curve?
    \end{enumerate} 
}


\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{1.a}


In the plot above, we can see a decrease in $g$
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\implies$] a decrease in the slope of $(n+g)k$
    \item[$\implies$] increase in the $k$ where $f(k)-(n+g)k=0$
    \item[$\implies$] increase in the $k$ where the $\kdot=0$ curve meets the $k$ axis
\end{itemize}

A decrease in the slope of $(n+g)k$ also implies that the distance between $(n+g)k$ and $f(k)$ will be larger $\forall k$ between 0 and where $f(k)-(n+g)k=0$.

\noindent
So, overall, a decrease in $g$ implies a vertical and horizontal stretch outward for the $\kdot = 0$ curve.

    \item How, if at all, does this affect the $\ccdot = 0$ curve?
    \end{enumerate} 
}

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{1.b}

Because $f'>0$ and $f''<0$ by assumption, the plot of $f'$ is shaped as in the above plot. Then when $g$ has decreased from $g_1$ to $g_2$, the intersection with $f'$ occurs at a higher $k^*$. Since $\ccdot=0$ occurs when $f'=\rho+\theta g$ and $\rho, \theta$ are constants, then the $\ccdot=0$ curve shifts to the right to a higher $k^*$.

}

Since $k_1^* < k_2^*$ from the plot in part (b)
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\implies$] immediately after the decrease from $g_1$ to $g_2$, $f'(k_1^*)>\rho+\theta g_2$.
    \item[$\implies$] $\dfrac{\ccdot}{c}\bigg|_{k=k_1^*,g=g_2} = \dfrac{f'(k_1^*) - \rho - \theta g_2}{\theta} > 0$
    \item[$\implies$] $\ccdot|_{k=k_1^*,g=g_2} > 0$
    \item[$\implies$] $c$ rises immediately after the decrease in $g$

    \end{enumerate} 
}

Since there is no depreciation, the real interest rate $r$ is equal to the marginal product of capital $f'(k)$ (since the price of output is assumed to be 1).

\begin{align*}
    \intertext{So}
    r-g &= f'(k) - g
    \intertext{And immediately after the change in g,}
    f'(k_1^*) - g_1
    \intertext{changes to}
    f'(k_1^*) - g_2
    \intertext{Since $f'(k)$ remains unchanged at the time of the change but $g$ decreases from $g_1$ to $g_2$,}
    f'(k_1^*) - g_2 &>  f'(k_1^*) - g_1\\
    r|_{g_1}-g_2 &> r|_{g_1}-g_1
    \intertext{So, at the time of the change, $r-g$ increases.}
\end{align*}

    \item In the long run, does $r-g$ rise, fall, or stay the same, or is it not possible to tell?
    \end{enumerate} 
}

\begin{align*}
    \intertext{Continuing my notation from parts (b)-(d), in the long run,}
    \lim_{t\to\infty}f'(k) &= f'(k_2^*)
    \intertext{So the change in $r-g$ in the long run will be}
    (r|_{g_2}-g_2) - (r|_{g_1}-g_1) &= (f'(k_2^*)-g_2) - (f'(k_1^*)-g_1) \\
        &= (\rho +\theta g_2 -g_2) - (\rho +\theta g_1-g_1) \\
        &= (\rho +(\theta-1) g_2) - (\rho +(\theta-1)g_1) \\
        &= (\theta-1) (g_2-g_1) \\
        &\begin{cases}
            >0 &\text{ if } \theta\in (0,1) \\
            <0 &\text{ if } \theta > 1
        \end{cases}
\end{align*}

Since there is no upper constraint on $\theta$ from the utility function ($\theta\in (0,1)$ and $\theta > 1$ both produce an upward sloping, convex function), then there is no way to tell, in general, if $r-g$ rises or falls without an estimate of $\theta$.

\problem{Capital taxation in the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model: Romer 2.10}{
    Consider a Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans economy that is on its balanced growth path. Suppose
that at some time, which we will call time 0, the government switches to a policy
of taxing investment income at rate $\tau$. Thus the real interest rate that households
face is now given by \[r(t) = (1-\tau) f'(k(t)).\] Assume that the government returns
the revenue it collects from this tax through lump-sum transfers. Finally, assume
that this change in tax policy is unanticipated.

    f'(\kone) &= \rho + \theta g
    \intertext{After the tax is introduced, $r(t)=(1-\tau) f'(k(t))$, so let $\ktwo$ denote $k$ when $\ccdot=0$ after the tax is introduced, satisfying}
    (1-\tau)f'(\ktwo) &= \rho + \theta g\\[1em]
